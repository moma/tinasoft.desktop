Description: 
        Whoosh is a fast, pure-Python indexing and search library. Programmers
        can use it to easily add search functionality to their applications and
        websites. Because Whoosh is pure Python, you don't have to compile or
        install a binary support library and/or make Python work with a JVM, yet
        Whoosh is still very fast at indexing and searching. Every part of how
        Whoosh works can be extended or replaced to meet your needs exactly.
