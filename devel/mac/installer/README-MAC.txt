1. FIRST TIME USE : INSTALLATION

 1. Decompress the .zip and please, remember the directory path (eg. "Downloads", or "Desktop")
 2. open a Terminal (search for the "Terminal" app in your mac and start it) 
 3. Go to the directory where you unpacked the .zip.
    This is really easy, you have to type "cd", followed by the directory path.
    
    For instance, if you decompressed the .zip in the "Downloads" folder, you should type:
    
       cd ~/Downloads/Tinasoft
       
 4. now, type:
      
       ./install.sh
      
       
 This will install the application to Applications > Tinasoft, and start the server.
 So you can then open Safari and go to http://localhost:8888

2. NORMAL USE : STARTING THE APPLICATION

 
  1. open a Terminal (search for the "Terminal" app in your mac and start it) 
  2. type "cd ~/Desktop"
  3. if it don't work, type "cd /Applications/Tinasoft"
  4. type "./Tinasoft"

  Safari should now open the "http://localhost:8888" website
  
  If it don't, start Safari manually, then go to the following address (the ":8888" is mandatory):

    http://localhost:8888

3. TROUBLESHOOTING

 If you don't see your whitelists or source-files, just refresh the page (this is not automatic yet).
 
 Safari is recommended
 
 You need a Spreadsheet editor
 
 When you close Safari and the Webpage, this won't stop the application and running computations.
 
 To really stop all computations, you need to click on "Server Shutdown"
