If you have linux 64 bits, simply go in the project root directory (current dir) and run:

  ./start
  
   to test the application
   
 
If you need other plateforms, you can run the script:


 ./package.sh
 
  To generate binaries for other plateforms in the "dist/" directory,
  and compressed archives (.tar.gz and .zip) for each plateform 
  in the project root directory (the current dir).
